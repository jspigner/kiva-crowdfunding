# kiva-crowdfunding
A project I completed with CareerFoundry. Kiva is a crowdfunding platform with an aim to make the world financially inclusive for all.

Visualizations: A folder of visualizations I made in Python via Jupyter Notebook. 

Scripts: All of the scripts I coded for the Kiva project: data cleaning and wrangling, exploring relationships, time-series data, geographic data, and some machine learning models.
