# kiva-crowdfunding
A project I completed with CareerFoundry. Kiva is a crowdfunding platform with an aim to make the world financially inclusive for all. 

Visualizations: A folder of visualizations I made in Python via Jupyter Notebook. 

Scripts: A folder of all of the scripts I coded for the Kiva project: data cleaning and wrangling, exploring relationships, time-series data, geographic data, and some machine learning models. 

Presentation: The final project is presented in Tableau: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/julie.spigner/viz/KivaDataAnalysis-Final/KivaDataAnalysis and in a PowerPoint Presentation format (see Kiva Data Analysis by JSpigner.pdf).
